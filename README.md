E-Organizer Application

Overview
The E-Organizer Application is a Python-based desktop utility built using Tkinter designed to automatically clean up and organize files within any selected directory. It sorts files into categorized subfolders (Audio, Documents, Images, Videos) based on their file extensions, moving any unrecognized files into an "Others" folder.

That's a great idea! Posting your file organizer on GitHub is perfect for showing off your skills.
